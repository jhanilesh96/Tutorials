Horseshoe prior vs Lasso based compressed sensing.

The prior is discussed in:
Neville, Sarah E., John T. Ormerod, and M. P. Wand. "Mean field variational Bayes for continuous sparse signal shrinkage: pitfalls and remedies." (2014): 1113-1151.

My (trivial) addition is the compressed sensing part
